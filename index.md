COVID-19 is a novel pathogen that can repeatedly infect, with infection resulting in an increased risk of many serious long-term health complications for people of all ages. It is evident that vaccination alone will not be enough to fully protect our communities from high rates of COVID infection and the resulting complications.

Relying on ‘personal responsibility’, without effective public health measures, will result in repeated waves of infection, an overloaded and dysfunctional healthcare system, and ongoing disruption to daily life. This scenario is currently playing out around the world. Instead, a collective approach is required that focuses on minimising transmission by means of public health policies. These measures should be viewed as protections rather than restrictions, and when combined with a high vaccination rate, would encompass a Vaccines Plus strategy.


## Actions to take now 

COVID-19 spreads predominantly by airborne transmission. Public health policies must aim to provide clean air within indoor environments to minimise infections. The evidence for this conclusion is extensive.

We urge the New Zealand Government to implement the following, as part of a Vaccines Plus strategy:

- Define and clearly communicate to the public a coherent mitigation strategy with well-defined goals. It is essential that this strategy recognises that the best outcomes for individuals and society will be achieved by maintaining low infection rates.
- Increase public education on the nature and predominance of airborne transmission of COVID-19, including the factors that increase risk, and how to mitigate these risks.
- Identify appropriate high-quality masks for public use (currently N95/P2/KN95/KF94) and inform the public that these masks are greatly superior to surgical masks. Ensure procurement and funding to avoid inequity of supply, including to schools. This policy must include the ongoing mandating of mask use in schools over the winter terms in 2022.
- Strengthen current ventilation measures in schools, including supplying CO2 monitoring and appropriately sized HEPA air filtration units to all New Zealand classrooms in time for winter months when windows cannot be kept open.
- Provide alternative learning arrangements and community-based support for school-aged children when necessary, to protect them and their families during periods of intense transmission. New Zealand needs to adopt a whānau-centred approach that protects the well-being of children and their families in all settings.
- Engage engineers, aerosol scientists and other ventilation specialists to develop clear ventilation standards for indoor public spaces, including standards for air changes, airborne pathogen filtration and inactivation, and maximum acceptable CO2 levels.
- Continue to actively promote and enable high vaccination coverage for all groups of society, including children, who currently have low vaccination rates.

The implications of continuing to allow poorly-mitigated transmission of COVID-19 in New Zealand are too great to ignore. The burden of long term illness and disability on individuals, whānau, and our health system of Covid and Long COVID will include effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, endocrine, and immune systems.
Recurrent waves of infection caused by waning immunity, new variants, and the premature removal of public health controls, would lead to an over-burdened healthcare system that would struggle to provide even standard services.

COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease, but transmission is preventable. The measures outlined here are inexpensive and highly effective strategies for suppressing infection rates, that will work in the background to keep people safe as they go about their daily lives. We believe these measures can create a ‘covid-hostile’ environment in New Zealand that would protect us not only from new variants, but also from other airborne respiratory infections.

In the face of high uncertainty about the future course and long-term impacts of the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic, New Zealand can again be a world leader if we embrace a comprehensive public health based, Vaccines Plus strategy.


## Who are we

We are a group of doctors and scientists, many of us experts in epidemiology, air quality, and medicine, who are calling on the New Zealand Government to adopt a comprehensive mitigation strateg of COVID-19.
